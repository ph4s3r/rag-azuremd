title: Frequently asked questions for managing resources with Azure Resource Manager
summary: |
  This article provides answers to common questions about Azure Resource Manager and how you use it for manage resources.

sections:
  - name: Resource groups
    questions:
      - question: Can a resource group be renamed?
        answer: |
          No, you can't rename a resource group. You need to create a new resource group with the desired name and move the resources to 
          the new resource group.
          
      - question: Are resource group names case sensitive?
        answer: |
          No, Azure resource group names aren't case sensitive. They're treated as case-insensitive, meaning "ResourceGroup1" and "resourcegroup1" are considered the same.

          When using various APIs to retrieve the name for a resource or resource group, the returned value may have different casing than what you 
          originally specified for the name.

          For more information about resource group names, see [Naming rules and restrictions](resource-name-rules.md#microsoftresources).  

      - question: What location should I choose for a resource group?  
        answer: |
          To ensure state consistency for the resource group, all control plane operations are routed through the resource group's location. When selecting a 
          resource group location, we recommend that you select a location close to where your control operations originate. Typically, this location is the one closest to 
          your current location.

  - name: Resources
    questions:
      - question: What happens if two operations update the same resource at the same time?
        answer: |
          Azure Resource Manager detects the conflict and permits only one operation to complete successfully. The other operation fails and returns a 409 conflict error.
          If the blocked operation has the correct state, you can retry the operation.
