# Quickstart: Use Terraform to create a virtual network

In this quickstart, you learn about a Terraform script that creates an Azure resource group and a virtual network with two subnets. The script generates the names of the resource group and the virtual network by using a random pet name with a prefix. The script also shows the names of the created resources in output.

The script uses the Azure Resource Manager (`azurerm`) provider to interact with Azure resources. It uses the  Random (`random`) provider to generate random pet names for the resources.

The script creates the following resources:

- A resource group: A container that holds related resources for an Azure solution.

- A virtual network: A fundamental building block for your private network in Azure.

- Two subnets: Segments of a virtual network's IP address range where you can place groups of isolated resources.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. You can [create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).

- [Installation and configuration of Terraform](/azure/developer/terraform/quickstart-configure).

## Implement the Terraform code

> [!NOTE]
> The sample code for this article is in the [Azure Terraform GitHub repo](https://github.com/Azure/terraform/tree/master/quickstart/101-virtual-network-create-two-subnets). You can view the log file that contains the [test results from current and previous versions of Terraform](https://github.com/Azure/terraform/tree/master/quickstart/101-virtual-network-create-two-subnets/TestRecord.md).
>
> For more articles and sample code that show how to use Terraform to manage Azure resources, see the [documentation page for Terraform on Azure](/azure/terraform).

1. Create a directory in which to test and run the sample Terraform code, and make it the current directory.

1. Create a file named *main.tf* and insert the following code:

    :::code language="Terraform" source="~/terraform_samples/quickstart/101-virtual-network-create-two-subnets/main.tf":::

1. Create a file named *outputs.tf* and insert the following code:

    :::code language="Terraform" source="~/terraform_samples/quickstart/101-virtual-network-create-two-subnets/outputs.tf":::

1. Create a file named *providers.tf* and insert the following code:

    :::code language="Terraform" source="~/terraform_samples/quickstart/101-virtual-network-create-two-subnets/providers.tf":::

1. Create a file named *variables.tf* and insert the following code:

    :::code language="Terraform" source="~/terraform_samples/quickstart/101-virtual-network-create-two-subnets/variables.tf":::

## Initialize Terraform

[!INCLUDE [terraform-init.md](~/azure-dev-docs-pr/articles/terraform/includes/terraform-init.md)]

## Create a Terraform execution plan

[!INCLUDE [terraform-plan.md](~/azure-dev-docs-pr/articles/terraform/includes/terraform-plan.md)]

## Apply a Terraform execution plan

[!INCLUDE [terraform-apply-plan.md](~/azure-dev-docs-pr/articles/terraform/includes/terraform-apply-plan.md)]

## Verify the results

#### [Azure CLI](#tab/azure-cli)

1. Get the Azure resource group name:

    ```console
    resource_group_name=$(terraform output -raw resource_group_name)
    ```

1. Get the virtual network name:

    ```console
    virtual_network_name=$(terraform output -raw virtual_network_name)
    ```

1. Use [`az network vnet show`](/cli/azure/network/vnet#az-network-vnet-show) to display the details of your newly created virtual network:

    ```azurecli
    az network vnet show \
        --resource-group $resource_group_name \
        --name $virtual_network_name
    ```
