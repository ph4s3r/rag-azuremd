# Quickstart: Use the Azure portal to create a virtual network

This quickstart shows you how to create a virtual network by using the Azure portal. You then create two virtual machines (VMs) in the network, deploy Azure Bastion to securely connect to the VMs from the internet, and start private communication between the VMs.

A virtual network is the fundamental building block for private networks in Azure. Azure Virtual Network enables Azure resources like VMs to securely communicate with each other and the internet.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. You can [create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).

## <a name="create-a-virtual-network"></a> Sign in to Azure

Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) with your Azure account.

[!INCLUDE [virtual-network-create-with-bastion.md](~/reusable-content/ce-skilling/azure/includes/virtual-network-create-with-bastion.md)]

[!INCLUDE [create-two-virtual-machines.md](../../includes/create-two-virtual-machines.md)]

## Connect to a virtual machine

1. In the portal, search for and select **Virtual machines**.

1. On the **Virtual machines** page, select **vm-1**.

1. In the **Overview** information for **vm-1**, select **Connect**.

1. On the **Connect to virtual machine** page, select the **Bastion** tab.

1. Select **Use Bastion**.

1. Enter the username and password that you created when you created the VM, and then select **Connect**.

## Start communication between VMs

1. At the bash prompt for **vm-1**, enter `ping -c 4 vm-2`.

   You get a reply similar to the following message:

    ```output
    azureuser@vm-1:~$ ping -c 4 vm-2
    PING vm-2.3bnkevn3313ujpr5l1kqop4n4d.cx.internal.cloudapp.net (10.0.0.5) 56(84) bytes of data.
    64 bytes from vm-2.internal.cloudapp.net (10.0.0.5): icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=1.83 ms
    64 bytes from vm-2.internal.cloudapp.net (10.0.0.5): icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=0.987 ms
    64 bytes from vm-2.internal.cloudapp.net (10.0.0.5): icmp_seq=3 ttl=64 time=0.864 ms
    64 bytes from vm-2.internal.cloudapp.net (10.0.0.5): icmp_seq=4 ttl=64 time=0.890 ms
    ```

1. Close the Bastion connection to **vm-1**.

1. Repeat the steps in [Connect to a virtual machine](#connect-to-a-virtual-machine) to connect to **vm-2**.

1. At the bash prompt for **vm-2**, enter `ping -c 4 vm-1`.

   You get a reply similar to the following message:

    ```output
    azureuser@vm-2:~$ ping -c 4 vm-1
    PING vm-1.3bnkevn3313ujpr5l1kqop4n4d.cx.internal.cloudapp.net (10.0.0.4) 56(84) bytes of data.
    64 bytes from vm-1.internal.cloudapp.net (10.0.0.4): icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.695 ms
    64 bytes from vm-1.internal.cloudapp.net (10.0.0.4): icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=0.896 ms
    64 bytes from vm-1.internal.cloudapp.net (10.0.0.4): icmp_seq=3 ttl=64 time=3.43 ms
    64 bytes from vm-1.internal.cloudapp.net (10.0.0.4): icmp_seq=4 ttl=64 time=0.780 ms
    ```

1. Close the Bastion connection to **vm-2**.

## Next steps

In this quickstart, you created a virtual network with two subnets: one that contains two VMs and the other for Bastion. You deployed Bastion, and you used it to connect to the VMs and establish communication between the VMs. To learn more about virtual network settings, see [Create, change, or delete a virtual network](manage-virtual-network.yml).

Private communication between VMs is unrestricted in a virtual network. To learn more about configuring various types of VM network communications, continue to the next article:
