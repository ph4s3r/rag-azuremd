# Tutorial: Route network traffic with a route table using the Azure portal

Azure routes traffic between all subnets within a virtual network, by default. You can create your own routes to override Azure's default routing. Custom routes are helpful when, for example, you want to route traffic between subnets through a network virtual appliance (NVA).

1. Select **Connect**.

1. Enter the following information at the prompt of the virtual machine to enable IP forwarding:

    ```bash
    sudo vim /etc/sysctl.conf
    ``` 

1. In the Vim editor, remove the **`#`** from the line **`net.ipv4.ip_forward=1`**:

    Press the **Insert** key.

    ```bash
    # Uncomment the next line to enable packet forwarding for IPv4
    net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
    ```

    Press the **Esc** key.

    Enter **`:wq`** and press **Enter**.

1. Close the Bastion session.

1. Restart the virtual machine.

## Create a route table

    | Setting | Value |
    | ------- | ----- |
    | Route name | Enter **to-private-subnet**. |
    | Destination type | Select **IP Addresses**. |
    | Destination IP addresses/CIDR ranges | Enter **10.0.2.0/24**. |
    | Next hop type | Select **Virtual appliance**. |
    | Next hop address | Enter **10.0.3.4**. </br> **_This is the IP address you of vm-nva you created in the earlier steps._**. |

    :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-create-route-table-portal/add-route.png" alt-text="Screenshot of route creation in route table.":::

1. Select **Add**.

1. Select **Subnets** in **Settings**.

1. Select **+ Associate**.

1. Enter or select the following information in **Associate subnet**:

    | Setting | Value |
    | ------- | ----- |
    | Virtual network | Select **vnet-1 (test-rg)**. |
    | Subnet | Select **subnet-1**. |

1. Select **OK**.

## Test the routing of network traffic

Test routing of network traffic from **vm-public** to **vm-private**. Test routing of network traffic from **vm-private** to **vm-public**.

### Test network traffic from vm-public to vm-private

1. In the search box at the top of the portal, enter **Virtual machine**. Select **Virtual machines** in the search results.

1. In **Virtual machines**, select **vm-public**.

1. Select **Connect** then **Connect via Bastion** in the **Overview** section.

1. Enter the username and password you entered when the virtual machine was created.

1. Select **Connect**.

1. In the prompt, enter the following command to trace the routing of network traffic from **vm-public** to **vm-private**:

    ```bash
    tracepath vm-private
    ```

    The response is similar to the following example:

    ```output
    azureuser@vm-public:~$ tracepath vm-private
     1?: [LOCALHOST]                      pmtu 1500
     1:  vm-nva.internal.cloudapp.net                          1.766ms 
     1:  vm-nva.internal.cloudapp.net                          1.259ms 
     2:  vm-private.internal.cloudapp.net                      2.202ms reached
     Resume: pmtu 1500 hops 2 back 1 
    ```
    
    You can see that there are two hops in the above response for **`tracepath`** ICMP traffic from **vm-public** to **vm-private**. The first hop is **vm-nva**. The second hop is the destination **vm-private**.

    Azure sent the traffic from **subnet-1** through the NVA and not directly to **subnet-private** because you previously added the **to-private-subnet** route to **route-table-public** and associated it to **subnet-1**.

1. Close the Bastion session.

### Test network traffic from vm-private to vm-public

1. In the search box at the top of the portal, enter **Virtual machine**. Select **Virtual machines** in the search results.

1. In **Virtual machines**, select **vm-private**.

1. Select **Connect** then **Connect via Bastion** in the **Overview** section.

1. Enter the username and password you entered when the virtual machine was created.

1. Select **Connect**.

1. In the prompt, enter the following command to trace the routing of network traffic from **vm-private** to **vm-public**:

    ```bash
    tracepath vm-public
    ```

    The response is similar to the following example:

    ```output
    azureuser@vm-private:~$ tracepath vm-public
     1?: [LOCALHOST]                      pmtu 1500
     1:  vm-public.internal.cloudapp.net                       2.584ms reached
     1:  vm-public.internal.cloudapp.net                       2.147ms reached
     Resume: pmtu 1500 hops 1 back 2 
    ```

    You can see that there's one hop in the above response, which is the destination **vm-public**.

    Azure sent the traffic directly from **subnet-private** to **subnet-1**. By default, Azure routes traffic directly between subnets.

1. Close the Bastion session.
